The Canadian Computing Competition practice

These are solutions to may problems in the University of Waterloo's
Candian Computing Competition (https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html). 
In the instances where I could not solve a problem, Milkien Mills High School provided
solutions and resources required to learn how to solve these problems (http://mmhs.ca/ccc/index.htm).
